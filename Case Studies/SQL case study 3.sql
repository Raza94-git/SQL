/*
 Problem Statement:
 You are the database developer of an international bank. You are responsible for
 managing the bankâ€™s database. You want to use the data to answer a few
 questions about your customers regarding withdrawal, deposit and so on,
 especially about the transaction amount on a particular date across various
 regions of the world. Perform SQL queries to get the key insights of a customer.
 
 Dataset:
 
 The 3 key datasets for this case study are:
 
 a. Continent: The Continent table has two attributes i.e., region_id and
 region_name, where region_name consists of different continents such as
 Asia, Europe, Africa etc., assigned with the unique region id.
 
 b. Customers: The Customers table has four attributes named customer_id,
 region_id, start_date and end_date which consists of 3500 records.
 
 c. Transaction: Finally, the Transaction table contains around 5850 records
 and has four attributes named customer_id, txn_date, txn_type and
 txn_amount.

 SELECT @TableName = EVENTDATA().value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/ObjectName)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(128)');

 In the above code:
 
 eventdata() - It is a system function in sql that captures detailed information about the event that triggered the DDL trigger
 It returns an XML result that contains metadata about the event (such as type of operation, the name of the affected object
 (in this case the table) and the user who executed the event)

 .value('(/EVENT_INSTANCE/ObjectName)[1]', 'NVARCHAR(128)')
 - This is an XML query on the data returned by eventdata().
 - It navigates through the XML structure to extract the value of the OBJECTNAME(in this case our table) element.
 - (/EVENT_INSTANCE/ObjectName)[1]: 
 - This XPath-like expression extracts the value of the <ObjectName> node, which represents the name of the object
(the table in this case) that triggered the event. 
/EVENT_INSTANCE is the root node in the XML returned by EVENTDATA(), 
and ObjectName is the child node that holds the table name.
 
 -The [1] means "get the first occurrence of this element," 
 which is useful when there might be multiple occurrences (though in this case, there should only be one table name).
 
 -'NVARCHAR(128)': This is the data type to which the result is converted. 
 In this case, it converts the value of ObjectName to an NVARCHAR(128) string.

 Example of EventData():

 <EVENT_INSTANCE>
  <EventType>DROP_TABLE</EventType>
  <ObjectName>MyTable</ObjectName>
  <ObjectType>TABLE</ObjectType>
  <TSQLCommand>DROP TABLE MyTable;</TSQLCommand>
  <LoginName>sa</LoginName>
</EVENT_INSTANCE>

RAISERROR ('Deletion of MyTable is not allowed!', 16, 1)
What is 16,1 in the above line?

1. 16 (Severity Level):
The severity level indicates how serious the error is. In SQL Server, severity levels range from 0 to 25.
16 is a common severity level for user-defined errors. 
It indicates general errors that can be corrected by the user. 
In this case, it is used to report an application error that doesn't crash the system but needs to be addressed by the user or developer.
Severity levels:
0â€“10: Informational messages, not considered as errors.
11â€“16: Errors that the user can fix (like invalid input).
17â€“25: System and hardware failures.

1 (State):
The state is an integer value that helps identify the location in the code where the error occurred. 
It is used to provide more context about the error.
In most user-defined errors, the state is just set to 1, meaning that it is a general user-defined error.
The state can be any value between 0 and 255, 
allowing developers to specify different states for the same error message to track different scenarios.
